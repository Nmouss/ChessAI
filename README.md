# What is this?
This project was a project that combined all of my knowledge in computer vision, OOP, machine learning and software engineering which includes reading documentation. I also learned a lot between GPUs, TPUs and CPUs when I was training my chess pieces model on a GTX 1080Ti.

# Packages (For mac users)

```
pip install ultralytics
pip install python-chess
pip install shapely
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
brew stockfish

run this command to find stockfish in files: which stockfish
```

# How can I use this?
You will need:

- External webcam

The ChessAI script has the algorithms that processes the images finds where the chess board corners are and find where the chess pieces are. Since I cannot attach the model here you can contact me or I will link a google drive for the models but I haven't decided what I want to do yet. Run the main script with the model detecting corners and chess pieces.

# Goal
My goal is to create glasses that a player can wear that has buttons so that they can either speak to the mic or click buttons so that the AI knows if its whites or blacks turn. So this project is not done but the main AI algorithm and computer vision parts are all done!
