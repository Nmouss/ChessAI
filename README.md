# Computer Vision ChessAI
This project was a project that combined all of my knowledge in computer vision, OOP, machine learning and software engineering which includes reading documentation. I also learned a lot between GPUs, TPUs and CPUs when I was training my chess pieces model on a GTX 1080Ti.
